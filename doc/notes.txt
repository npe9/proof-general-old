Notes to include in documentation.

Why is C-c C-b useful?  Could just use the file to read it one go
(will we have a command to do this other than via the process?).
BUT it's nice because it stops exactly where a proof fails, so you can
continue development from there.

Suggestions for improving web pages after Rod reading them:

  - slideshow rather than single screen shot
  - separate feature list
  - explain what a proof script is and what script management buys you

Get Dave a laptop to demo on.

Support for fume-function.

fume-func is a handy package which makes a menu from the function
declarations in a buffer.  Proof General configures fume-func so
that you can quickly jump to particular proofs in a script buffer.

If you want to use fume-func, you may need to enable it for
yourself.  It is distributed with XEmacs (and FSF GNU Emacs)
but by not enabled by default.  To enable it you should find
the file fume-func.el and follow the instructions there.  
If you have XEmacs 20.4, what you need to do is this:

  ......

If you have any other version of Emacs, you should check the
fume-func.el file

Isabelle with multiple files.

Multiple file support only works for .ML files which are read via
the theory loader, with use_thy.  If you want to load .ML files which
aren't associated with theories, it's best to use a dummy theory,
see [Reference to Isabelle manual]
