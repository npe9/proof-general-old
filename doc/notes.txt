Notes to include in documentation.

Why is C-c C-b useful?  Could just use the file to read it one go
(will we have a command to do this other than via the process?).
BUT it's nice because it stops exactly where a proof fails, so you can
continue development from there.

Suggestions for improving web pages after Rod reading them:

  - slideshow rather than single screen shot
  - separate feature list
  - explain what a proof script is and what script management buys you

Get Dave a laptop to demo on.

Isabelle with multiple files.

Multiple file support only works for .ML files which are read via
the theory loader, with use_thy.  If you want to load .ML files which
aren't associated with theories, it's best to use a dummy theory,
see [Reference to Isabelle manual]
