-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. How can I keep the Proof General option settings across sessions?

A. Simply use the ordinary XEmacs menu: Options -> Save Options

   In FSF Emacs, you can do M-x customize-save-customized
   or use the Custom->Save menu in a customize buffer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q. When using X-Symbol, why do I sometimes see funny characters like
   \233 in the buffer?

A. These are part of the 8 bit character codes used by X Symbol to
   get symbols from particular fonts.  Sometimes X-Symbol forgets to
   fontify the buffer properly to make it use the right fonts.
   To fix, type M-x font-lock-fontify-buffer
   If that doesn't work, type M-x font-lock-mode twice to turn
   font-lock off then on.  Or reload the file.

Q. I'm using Proof General for prover X, then I load a file for prover Y.
   The buffer doesn't enter the mode for prover Y.  Why not?

A. Unfortunately the architecture of Proof General is designed so
   that you can only use one prover at a time in the same Emacs
   session.   If you want to run more than one prover at a time,
   you have to run more than one Emacs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


Q. How do I use Proof General for Isabelle/Isar instead of Isabelle classic?

A. There are several ways:

   1. Use the Isabelle settings mechanism, invoke with "Isabelle"
   2. Set the environment variable PROOFGENERAL_ASSISTANTS=isar
      before starting Emacs.
   3. Put the line (* -*- isar -*- *) at the top of your Isar files.

   Unfortunately Isabelle/Isar and Isabelle classic are two quite
   separate Proof General instances.  Ideally they should be
   combined into one, if anyone fancies some elisp hacking...

Q. Can I join any mailing lists for Proof General?

A. Of course, email "majordomo@dcs.ed.ac.uk" with the 
   lines "subscribe proofgeneral" or "subscribe proofgeneral-devel"
   in the message body.
