Proof General is a generic Emacs interface for proof assistants.

This is version 3.5 of Proof General.   
(Check About screen for a precise version number; also see CHANGES).

The aim of the Proof General project is to provide a powerful and
configurable interfaces which help user-interaction with interactive
proof assistants.  Proof General targets power users rather than
novices, but we include general user interface niceties, such as
toolbar and menus, which make use easier for all.

Please help us with this aim!  Configure Proof General for your proof
assistant, by adding features at the generic level wherever possible.

 generic/   Generic basis for Proof General

A small number of example proofs are included in each prover 
subdirectory.   The "root2" example proofs of the irrationality
of the square root of 2 were proofs written as a response
to a challenge of Freek Wiedijk in his comparison of different
theorem provers, see http://www.cs.kun.nl/~freek/comparison/.
Those proof scripts are copyright by their named authors.

Check BUGS files for problems and issues, in this directory, and for
specific issues, in each prover subdirectory.  Please report bugs
not mentioned in any of these files to da+pg-bugs@inf.ed.ac.uk
