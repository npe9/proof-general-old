NEWSFLASH:

For the forseeable future, all Proof General pages are hosted on my
personal server, zermelo.dcs.ed.ac.uk, so replace "www.dcs" or
"www.lfcs.informatics" by "zermelo.dcs" in all URLs mentioned in the
sources and documentation.  (There is an indirection in place via
www.lfcs.informatics but it is not totally reliable, unfortunately)
