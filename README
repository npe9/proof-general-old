Proof General --- Organize your proofs!

The aim of the Proof General project is to provide a powerful and
configurable interfaces which help user-interaction with interactive
proof assistants.  Proof General targets power users rather than
novices, but we include general user interface niceties, such as
toolbar and menus, which make use easier for all.
