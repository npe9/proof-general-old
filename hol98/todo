* Things to do for HOL

See also ../todo for generic things to do, priority codes.

** A Problem with process filtering.

  Process (sometimes?) doesn't recover after interrupt, and no output
  is seen.  Why?  

  Also problem with some input texts: try interactive version of
  clScript.sml, inductive defn of CL terms breaks things.  

** B Improve display to strip ugly val it and spurious >'s.

** B Add special markup to improve robustness

** B Add support for multiple files

** B Add support for proof by pointing.

** B Output highlighting doesn't seem to work properly.
