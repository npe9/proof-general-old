<li><b>11th December 2003</b>
<p>
Please <b>update your links!</b>.  The server <tt>zermelo.dcs.ed.ac.uk</tt>
hosting Proof General for the last 5 years has now been retired.
Moroever, the Proof General .org domain has been poached from us.
</p>
<p>
Please refer to the web site using the URL
<b><a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk">proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk</a></b>
and do not send any email to the old .org addresses (contact 
David Aspinall directly).  Also, beware that the old addresses are built
into the help function of Proof General and the bug reporting commands.
Please download the upcoming pre-release (available soon) 
which has offending addresses removed.

<p>
Good news!  The license conditions for Proof General will shortly be
changed to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.
This relaxes the current conditions in several ways, in particular,
allowing packaging and distribution of the code by others.
