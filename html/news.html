<li><b>8th May 2001</b>
<p>
Proof General has had a few quiet improvements since October, which
appear in the current 
<a href="develdownload.html">development release</a>.
This version also has some compatibility fixes
for the recent releases of Emacs (20.7) and XEmacs (21.4).
<br>
Emacs Lisp and the Emacsen libraries has to be one of the
worst moving target platforms to develop an application on.
Please test out this version let us know of any problems.
Once things are looking good, we'll release PG 3.3
