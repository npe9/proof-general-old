<p>
Final week of testing for Proof General 3.2.  
The last chance to report bugs or request (minor) improvements for this release.
Please help us by trying out the 
<a href="develdownload.html">pre-release</a>, especially if you are
relying on an older or non-standard Emacs version.
Also check to see if the new 
manuals are useful: now split into
the user manual in
<?php htmlshow("ProofGeneral/doc/ProofGeneral_toc.html","HTML","Proof General manual") ?>,
<?php download_link("ProofGeneral/doc/ProofGeneral.ps.gz", "ps") ?> 
or  
<?php download_link("ProofGeneral/doc/ProofGeneral.pdf", "pdf") ?>,
and the separate "adapting" manual, in
<?php htmlshow("ProofGeneral/doc/PG-adapting_toc.html","HTML","Adapting Proof General manual") ?>,
<?php download_link("ProofGeneral/doc/PG-adapting.ps.gz", "ps") ?> 
or  
<?php download_link("ProofGeneral/doc/PG-adapting.pdf", "pdf") ?>.
(Info files are included in the distribution).
</p>
<li><b>14th Sep 2000</b>
<p>
Improvements to web pages.  Graphics made smaller, text more concise.
Please <?php hlink("feedback.html","send me suggestions ","Feedback form")?>
for further improvements.
(I know some pages display poorly in Netscape 4.7x because 
of patchy stylesheet support; they appear much better in IE5
or the rather impressive recent versions of KDE's Konqueror).

<p>
We're starting the testing phase for Proof General 3.2.  
It has several new features and improvements.
Please try out the <a href="develdownload.html">pre-release</a>
version, and report any problems to us.  Your
feedback is very important because we have no resources available for
serious compatibility testing ourselves.
</p>
<p>
We hope to release 3.2 by the end of September.
