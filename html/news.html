<h2>News about Proof General</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>1st July 2002</b>
<p>
Good news!  The license conditions for Proof General will shortly be
changed to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.
This relaxes the current conditions in several ways, in particular,
allowing packaging and distribution of the code by others.
</p>
<li><b>19th June 2002</b>
<p>
We plan to release version <b>3.4</b> of Proof General 
in August.  This update will have several significant 
improvements
(notably to the synchronization support for Coq), and also includes
fixes and updates for recent versions of Emacs (notably GNU Emacs 21.x) 
and various proof assistants.
<br>
<b>Please, please, please</b> do test the <a
href="develdownload.html">development release</a> for us in the
meantime and <a href="feedback">report any difficulties</a>, 
to help make the next release of Proof General as 
robust as possible.  Thanks!
