<li><b>11th December 2001</b>
<p>
The current <a href="devel.html">development release</a> takes
advantage of the new fancy features available in GNU Emacs 21, to add
toolbar support and other features there.  As usual, maintaining the
code to work with both Emacs versions is quite troublesome, so bug
reports and patches from users are very welcome.
