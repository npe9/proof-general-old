<p>
We plan to release version <b>3.4</b> of Proof General in the
next few weeks.  This update will have several significant improvements
(notably to the synchronization support for Coq), and also includes
fixes and updates for recent versions of (X)Emacs and various proof assistants.
<br>
<b>Please, please, please</b> do test the <a
href="develdownload.html">development release</a> for us in the
meantime and <a href="feedback">report any difficulties</a>, 
to help make the next release of Proof General as 
robust as possible.  Thanks!
