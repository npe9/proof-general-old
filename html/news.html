There is a new <a href="develdownload">development</a> version of
Proof General released today.  There are some minor fixes, and an
updated version of X-Symbol bundled.  Please test it and let me know
how you get on.  It would be nice to release the final version 3.5 at
last.

Good news!  The license conditions for Proof General will shortly be
changed to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.
This relaxes the current conditions in several ways, in particular,
allowing packaging and distribution of the code by others.
