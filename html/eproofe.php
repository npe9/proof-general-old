<p> 
Proof General, and particularly, the <a href="kit">Proof General
Kit</a> is proposed as a vehicle for research into <i>engineering
electronic proof<i>.  We want to investigate the
maintenance, combination, and reuse of formal proof developments.
</p>

<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>
This project has not yet been started, and there are no public
documents available yet.
</p>
<p>
Some hints of our plans appear in the papers describing
the <a href="kit">Proof General Kit</a>.
