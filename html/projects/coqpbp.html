<h2>Proof-by-pointing support for Coq</h2>
<p>
Coq already has sophisticated notions of proof-by-pointing,
and old work on support for Proof General may be helpful.  
We want to integrate with the latest version of Coq's
proof-by-pointing, possibly improving Proof General's
support along the way.

<b>Skills:</b>
 Some understanding of Coq implementation, co-operation with
 the Coq developers to get any Coq modifications (if any) incorporated.
 Minimal Emacs Lisp knowledge.
