<h2>Proof General for HOL</h2> 
<p> 
It is fairly easy to get basic support for Proof General for 
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/HVG/HOL/HOL.html">HOL</a>, and
this has recently been tried for HOL 98.  However, it would be a bigger
and more interesting project to get proper and complete support for
HOL working.  There are a couple of problems unique to HOL.
</p>
<p>
Much more than Isabelle, HOL relies on its meta language, ML.  HOL
proof scripts often use batch-oriented single step tactic proofs
constructed in ML, but Proof General does not offer an easy way to
edit these kind of proofs (as opposed to multi-step interactive
proofs).  The "Boomburg" Emacs interface by Koichi Takahashi and
Masima Hagiya addressed this problem, as well as providing support for
proof-by-pointing to HOL.  Their interface (which is no longer
maintained) could perhaps be embedded or reimplemented inside Proof
General.  Implemented in a generic way, batch script editing would
also be useful for Isabelle.
</p>
<p>
Another problem is that HOL scripts sometimes use SML structures,
which can cause confusion because Proof General does not really parse
SML, it just looks for semicolons.  Again, this could be improved by
taking a better parser (e.g. from sml mode).
