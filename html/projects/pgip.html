<h2>A New Protocol for Interactive Proof in Proof General</h2>
<p>
PGIP is a protocol for interactive proof to be used in the next
version of Proof General.  It is based around the present protocol,
but implemented with a standard collection of messages rather than
different messages for different proof assistants.  An outline of PGIP
and an experimental DTD
is given in the <a href="/home/da/drafts/#white">white paper</a>.  A
first implementation of PGIP will consist of (1) a filter (or
modification of the output routines) for an existing proof assistant,
which could be implemented in perl or some other language; and (2) a
new backend for Proof General in Emacs, which configures it for PGIP.
