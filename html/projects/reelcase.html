<h2>A ClearCase-like Configuration Management tool for Linux</h2>
<p>
Managing large libraries of theories and proofs, good software
engineering practices of configuration management become important
when using proof assistants.  One powerful and popular configuration
management tool is the commercial <a
href="http://www.rational.com/products/clearcase/index.jtmpl">Rational
ClearCase</a>.  
</p>
<p>
The crucial way that ClearCase goes beyond CVS is in providing a view
of a configuration directly through a special mountpoint on
the filesystem.  
</p>
<p>
This is a project to implement a kernel-level filesystem driver for
Linux using the Linux VFS to create a ClearCase-like view of a
configuration, through a mountable filesystem.  The underlying
configuration management could be done through RCS or CVS, perhaps
invoked via a companion user-level process.
Particular revisions of files should be accessible through names
interpreted specially by the filesystem driver, and some
user-level commands will be needed for other operations.
