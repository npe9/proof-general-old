<h2>Implementing Atomic Command Sequences</h2>
<p>
In Proof General, the blue region of a script buffer contains the
initial segment of the proof script which has been processed
successfully. It consists of atomic sequences of commands
(ACS). Retraction is supported to the beginning of every ACS. By
default, every command is an ACS. But the granularity of atomicity
should be able to be adjusted.
</p>
<p>
This adjustment is essential when arbitrary retraction is not
supported in the prover. Usually, after a theorem has been proved, one
may only retract to the start of the goal. One needs to mark the proof
of the theorem as an ACS. At present, support for these goal-save
sequences has been hard wired. No other ACS are currently
supported. We need a generalisation to overcome this deficiency.
</p>
<p>
This improvement should allow support for Coq's <i>Section</i> command,
LEGO's <i>Discharge</i> and simplified support for Isabelle/Isar,
by removing some of the prover-specific code.
