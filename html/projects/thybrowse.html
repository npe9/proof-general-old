<h2>A Generic Theory Browser</h2>
<p>
Proof General has very limited mechanisms for helping the user find
theorems and definitions during a proof.  It has notion of displaying
a "current context" for a proof, and configuration with a proof
engine command for searching for theorems.  It would be useful to
extend these facilities with a <i>theory browser</i> for investigating
the theories currently defined in a running proof assistant.  This
involves designing a small protocol to communicate with the proof
assistant and a generic way of displaying theories which have
different aspects from system to system.  A way which would
fit in well with Emacs would be to use a <tt>dired</tt>-like
buffer.
</p>
<p>
An alternative version of this project would be to write a standalone
theory browser which uses an extension of the forthcoming Proof
General standardized protocol for interaction (see white paper <a
href="/home/da/drafts/#white">here</a>).  This could be implemented in
Java, or in a functional language, Perl, C or C++, so long as a nice
toolkit is chosen (Qt or GTK).
