<h2>An Experimental CORBA binding and IDL mapping for ML</h2>
<p>
The future version of Proof General may use CORBA as a communication
mechanism between different components.  CORBA is also used by the
Unix/Linux desktops KDE and GNOME, which use the free implementations
MICO and ORBIT respectively.  We would like to be able to use ML to
write to interface with other CORBA components on the desktop and 
network.  For this a binding for ORB functions in ML is needed, as well 
as perhaps a mapping from the CORBA IDL into Standard ML, so that
we can write CORBA enabled applications in SML.  
</p>
<p>
This project involves the design and implementation of an experimental
version (subset of features) of such a system, using one of the
open-source ML compilers such as Moscow ML, Poly/ML or OCaml (in fact,
there is already some handling of COM in OCaml which can be used to
access an ORB).  Essentially, we want to analyse the feasibility
and performance of using a CORBA architecture for Proof General.
</p>
<p>
An CORBA binding for Haskell would also be an interesting project.

<b>Skills:</b>
Good ML, C, C++, programming skills and understanding of abstraction
mechanisms, basic understanding of CORBA and willing to get to
grasps with some of MICO or ORBIT.
