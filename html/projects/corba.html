<h2>An Experimental CORBA binding for ML</h2>
<p>
The future version of Proof General may use CORBA as a communication
mechanism between different components.  CORBA is also used by the
Unix/Linux desktops KDE and GNOME, which the free implementations MICO
and ORBIT.  We would like to be able to use ML to write applications
and utilities in, to interface with other CORBA components on the
desktop and network.  For this a CORBA binding for ML is needed.  This
project involves the design and implementation of such a binding,
using one of the open-source ML compilers such as Moscow ML, Poly/ML
or OCaml (there may already be a project underway for the last of
these).

<p>
A CORBA binding for Haskell would also be an interesting project.
