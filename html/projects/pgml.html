<h2>Specification and tools for PGML</h2>
<p> 
PGML is the proposed logical markup language for future versions of
Proof General.  The basic version legitimizes the present markup
scheme which is used by Proof General (based on 8-bit characters).
The ideas for PGML are described in the white paper 
<a href="/home/da/drafts/#white">here</a>, and an experimental
DTD is given there.  This project is to refine the specification
of PGML, and develop some tools for using it.  Various tools are desirable,
including: (1) translation tools which convert PGML to various other
formats, such as HTML and LaTeX.  (2) a display tool which displays PGML 
inside Emacs, or converts it to HTML for display by a web browser; 
(3) a filter or revised version of LEGO which converts its 8-bit markup 
into PGML, for testing purposes.  We need the last tool for other
proof assistants too.
