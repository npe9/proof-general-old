<h2>Proof-by-pointing support for Isabelle</h2>
<p>

the internal abstract syntax.  This issue needs to be solved to
support proof-by-pointing (and other features) in Isabelle.

providing term structure annotations for a previous release of
Isabelle may be useful here.  To implement proof-by-pointing itself,
tactics using the gesture information must be written.
