<h2>A Web-based Proof Replayer for Proof General</h2>
<p>
One of the nice features of Proof General is that it is very easy to
replay existing proofs, by mouse clicks alone.  No low-level
understanding of a proof assistant is needed to step through proofs.
We would like to have a web-based version of Proof General which
allowed for this proof replay (at least), perhaps running a proof
assistant remotely.  The main aspect is to implement an engine for
script management (colouring of lines of files), displaying in a web
browser, sending lines to a proof assistant process, and displaying the
results.  Ideally, the ideas for new standard protocols for Proof
General in the <a href="/home/da/drafts/#white">white paper</a> would
be followed.
