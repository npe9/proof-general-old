<h2>A Test Harness and Test Suite for Proof General</h2>
<p>
As Proof General becomes a more complex system, we badly need some way
of performing automatic functional testing, to ensure that changes and
extensions preserve functional correctness.  Although classical
testing of interfaces involves manually following a checklist of
actions and observations, it should be straightforward to automate
this using Emacs Lisp.  Interactive actions can be simulated by
certain function calls, and their results can be determined by
examining the contents of the edit buffers.  This project proposes the
design and implementation of a test harness and accompanying test
suite to test some of the core functions of Proof General.
Ultimately, the tests should be run as part of the build process
before each development release is allowed to go ahead.
