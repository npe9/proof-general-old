<h2><a name="prereq">
    What you need to run Proof General
    </a>
</h2>
<p>
To run Proof General, you should have:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Version 20.4 or later (21.1 is recommended)
of <a href="http://www.xemacs.org">XEmacs</a>
(this UK 
<a href="http://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/Mirrors/ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/">
ftp mirror</a> may help).
<br>
<b>or</b> version 20.2 or later (20.4 recommended) of the much poorer 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">FSF GNU Emacs</a>.
<br>
Both Emacsen are available for a variety of platforms, including
Unix variants and NT.
</li>
<li>
For displaying logical and mathematical symbols, the excellent
<a href="http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/~wedler/x-symbol/">X-Symbol</a>
package. 
<br>X-Symbol presently only works with XEmacs.  
Its use with Proof General is optional.
</li>
<li>
For FSF Emacs, a version of <tt>func-menu.el</tt> to get 
<?php link_root("features#funcmenu","function menus") ?>.
<br>I can't find a version of this that
works with current FSF Emacs releases. I'd be grateful 
for a pointer to one.  (Alternatively, the package 
<tt>imenu.el</tt> may be a suitable replacement,
and it ships with both Emacs.  Perhaps  
somebody could contribute patches to use that 
instead of <tt>func-menu</tt>).
<br>
Proof General works fine without this feature.
</ul>

<h2><a name="stable">
    Proof General Version 3.0, released 26th November 1999
    </a>
</h2>

<p>
Proof General is available in two formats:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> gzip'ed tar file: 
      <?php download_link("ProofGeneral-3.0.tar.gz") ?>
  </li>
 <li> Linux RPM package:
      <?php download_link("ProofGeneral-3.0-1.noarch.rpm") ?>
     <br>
     You probably don't need the 
      <?php download_link("ProofGeneral-3.0-1.src.rpm",
	"source RPM") ?>.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
Both the tarball and the RPM package include the generic elisp
code, <br>
code for LEGO, Coq, and Isabelle, installation instructions
and documentation (in Info and HTML formats).
</p>
<p>
Documentation is available in other formats
here <?php link_root("doc","here") ?>.  
If you want to format the documentation yourself,
you may like to download the
<?php download_link("ProofGeneralPortrait.eps.gz", 
"front page image") ?>.
</p>

<p>
This version of Proof General has been tested
with XEmacs 21.1 and FSF Emacs 20.4.
It supports Coq version 6.3, LEGO version 1.3.1 and
Isabelle99.
<p>
Check the <?php fileshow("ProofGeneral-3.0/CHANGES","CHANGES"); ?> file
for a summary of changes since version 2.1.
<p>

<h3> Easy installation! </h3> 
<p>
To use Proof General, simply unpack the sources with 
</p>
 <blockquote>
   <tt>tar -xpzf ProofGeneral-3.0.tar.gz</tt>
 </blockquote>
<p>
(use <tt>gunzip</tt> first in place of -z if you don't have GNU tar),<br>
and then add this one line to your .emacs file:
</p>
 <blockquote>
  <tt> (load-file "<var>directory</var>/generic/proof-site.el")</tt>
 </blockquote>
<p>
Where <var>directory</var> is the directory in which you unpacked
the sources.  
<br>
If you use the RPM package, <var>directory</var> is
<tt>/usr/share/emacs/ProofGeneral</tt>
</p>
<p>
Further customization is possible via the Customize menus in
Emacs.  
<br>
See the <?php fileshow("ProofGeneral-3.0/INSTALL","INSTALL")?> 
file in the distribution for more details.
