<a name="stable"><h2>Proof General Version 2.0, released 16 December 1998</h2></a>

<p>
This version of Proof General has been tested
with XEmacs 20.4 and FSF Emacs 20.2, 20.3<br>
It is available in two formats:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> gzip'ed tar file: 
      <?php download_link("ProofGeneral-2.0.tar.gz") ?>
  </li>
 <li> Linux RPM package:
      <?php download_link("ProofGeneral-2.0-1.noarch.rpm") ?>
     <br>
     The source RPM is 
      <?php download_link("ProofGeneral-2.0-1.noarch.rpm","here") ?>.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
Both the tarball and the RPM package include the generic elisp
code, <br>
code for LEGO, Coq, and Isabelle, installation instructions
and documentation. 
</p>

<h3> Easy installation! </h3> 
<p>
To use Proof General, simply unpack the sources with 
</p>
 <blockquote>
   <tt>tar -xpzf ProofGeneral-2.0.tar.gz</tt>
 </blockquote>
<p>
(use <tt>gunzip</tt> in place of -z if you don't have GNU tar),<br>
and then add this one line to your .emacs file:
</p>
 <blockquote>
  <tt> (load-file "<var>directory</var>/generic/proof-site.el")</tt>
 </blockquote>
<p>
Where <var>directory</var> is the directory in which you unpacked
the sources.  
<br>
If you use the RPM package, <var>directory</var> is
<tt>/usr/share/emacs/ProofGeneral</tt>
</p>
<p>
Further customization is possible via the Customize menus in
Emacs.  
<br>
See the <?php fileshow("ProofGeneral/INSTALL","INSTALL")?> 
file in the distribution for more details.

<h3><a name="devel">For Developers</a></h3>
<p>
If you are interested in helping to develop the core of Proof General,
you may like to download a complete archive of all the sources used to
build the Proof General pre-release.  The difference from the working
version distribution above is that we include our low-level list of
things to do, some developer's make files used to generate
documentation files and the release itself from our CVS repository,
some test files, sources for some of the images (in <a
href="http://www.gimp.org">GIMP</a> form), and the web pages.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> gzip'ed tar file: 
<!-- WARNING!  Line below automatically edited by makefile. -->
      <?php download_link("ProofGeneral-2.1pre990701-devel.tar.gz") ?>
<!-- End Warning. -->
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
You probably <em>don't</em> need to download this if you're only
interested in hacking the Emacs lisp part of the program (but you may
still like to check the latest
<!-- WARNING!  Line below automatically edited by makefile. -->
<?php fileshow("ProofGeneral-2.1pre990701/todo","low-level to-do list"); ?>).
<!-- End Warning. -->
</p>

<p>
If there is any interest from developers, we could make our
CVS repository open to anonymous cvs server access.  Please 
<a href="feedback.phtml">ask</a>.
