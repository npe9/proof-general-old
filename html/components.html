<h2>Spans: Emacs and XEmacs compatibility library for overlays/extents</h2>

<p>
<i>Spans</i> are an abstraction of XEmacs <i>extents</i> used to help
bridge the gulf between GNU Emacs and XEmacs.  In GNU Emacs, spans are
implemented using <i>overlays</i>.  
</p>
<p>
The library consists of three Emacs lisp files,
<ul>
<li><a href="ProofGeneral-latest/generic/span-extent.el">span-extent.el</a>
</li>
<li><a href="ProofGeneral-latest/generic/span-overlay.el">span-overlay.el</a>
</li>
<li><a href="ProofGeneral-latest/generic/span.el">span.el</a> 
(which simply loads one of the above)
</li>
</ul>
which implement a common interface for overlays/extents.
This library was originally implemented by Healfdene Goguen.
</p>
<p>
See the files for further documentation, and 
<a href="adapting_13.html#SEC40">section 12.1</a>
of the <a href="adaptingman">Proof General adapting manual</a>
for more details.

<h2>Docstring magic: Elisp documentation to TeXinfo extraction</h2>

<p>
This package generates <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/texinfo.html">Texinfo</a> source
fragments from Emacs 
<!-- WARNING: next URL subject to change with elisp ref man changes!! -->
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/elisp/html_node/elisp_374.html#SEC374">documentation strings</a> which are embedded in Emacs lisp source and the 
running interpreter.  This avoids documenting functions
and variables in more than one place, and automatically adds Texinfo
markup to docstrings.  It's a bit like <tt>javadoc</tt> for Emacs
Lisp, except that you must write a skeleton <tt>texi</tt> file which
contains magic comments mentioning the function or variable names you
want documented.  </p> <p> The package consists of one file: <ul>
<li><a
href="ProofGeneral-latest/generic/texi-docstring-magic.el">texi-docstring-magic.el</a></li>
</ul> which contains documentation and usage hints.  For an extensive
example of it's use, see the <a
href="ProofGeneral-latest/doc/PG-adapting.texi">source</a> for the <a
href="adapting">PG adapting manual</a>.  </p>
