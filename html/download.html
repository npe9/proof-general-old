<h2><a name="prereq">
    What you need to run Proof General
    </a>
</h2>
<p>
To run Proof General, you <strong>must</strong> have:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Version 21.1 or later 
of <a href="http://www.xemacs.org">XEmacs</a>
(this UK 
<a href="http://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/Mirrors/ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/">
ftp mirror</a> may help).
<br>
<b>or</b> version 20.5 or later of the much poorer 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">FSF GNU Emacs</a>.
<br>
Both Emacsen are available for a variety of platforms, including
Unix variants and Windows 95/98/NT.
</li>
<li>
One or more of the supported proof assistants.  Or write your own
support for a new assistant.  
<br>
See the 
<a href="main">front page</a> for links to supported
assistants.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

There are also some <strong>optional</strong> components for using
Proof General:
<ul>
<li>
For displaying logical and mathematical symbols, the excellent
<a href="http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/~wedler/x-symbol/">X-Symbol</a>
package. 
<br>It's very easy to install.  See <a href="#xsyminstall">here</a> 
for installation notes.
<br>X-Symbol presently only works with XEmacs on systems running X.  
</li>
<!-- <li> -->
<!-- For FSF Emacs, a version of <tt>func-menu.el</tt> to get  -->
<!-- <a href="features#funcmenu">function menus</a>. -->
<!-- <br>Unfortunately I can't find a version of this that -->
<!-- works with current FSF Emacs releases. I'd be grateful  -->
<!-- for a pointer to one.   -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- (The package  -->
<!-- <tt>imenu.el</tt> may be a suitable replacement, -->
<!-- and it ships with both Emacsen.  Perhaps   -->
<!-- somebody could contribute patches to use that  -->
<!-- instead of <tt>func-menu</tt>). -->
</ul>

<h2><a name="stable">
    Proof General Version 3.2, released 2nd October 2000
    </a>
</h2>

<p>
Proof General is available as an archive and an RPM package.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> gzip'ed tar file: 
      <?php download_link("ProofGeneral-3.2.tar.gz") ?>,
      <br>
      or the same thing in a zip file:
      <?php download_link("ProofGeneral-3.2.zip") ?>,
  </li>
 <li> Linux RPM package:
      <?php download_link("ProofGeneral-3.2-1.noarch.rpm") ?>
     <br>
     You probably don't need the 
      <?php download_link("ProofGeneral-3.2-1.src.rpm",
	"source RPM") ?>.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
Both the tarball and the RPM package include the generic elisp
code, <br>
code for the supported provers, installation instructions
and documentation in Info and HTML formats.
</p>
<p>
Documentation is available in other formats
here <a href="doc">here</a>.  
If you want to format the documentation yourself,
you may like to download the
<?php download_link("ProofGeneralPortrait.eps.gz", 
"front page image") ?>.
</p>

<p>
This version of Proof General has been tested
with XEmacs 21.1 and (briefly with) FSF Emacs 20.7.
It supports Coq version 6.3, LEGO version 1.3.1 and
Isabelle99-1.
</p>
<p>
Check the <?php fileshow("ProofGeneral-3.2/CHANGES","CHANGES"); ?> file
for a summary of changes since version 3.1.

<h3><a name="install">Easy installation</a></h3> 
<p>
To use Proof General, simply unpack the sources with 
</p>
 <blockquote>
   <tt>tar xpzf ProofGeneral-3.2.tar.gz</tt>
 </blockquote>
<p>
(use <tt>gunzip</tt> first in place of <tt>z</tt> if you don't have
GNU tar),<br> and then add this one line to your .emacs file:
</p>
 <blockquote>
  <tt> (load-file "<var>directory</var>/generic/proof-site.el")</tt>
 </blockquote>
<p>
Where <var>directory</var> is the directory in which you unpacked
the sources.  
<br>
If you use the RPM package, <var>directory</var> is
<tt>/usr/share/emacs/ProofGeneral</tt>
</p>
<p>
If you're using Windows, then download the zip file.
<br> 
Use a zip file utility to unpack it somewhere, for example
<tt>c:\\ProofGeneral</tt>
</p>
<p>
Further customization is possible via the Customize menus in
Emacs.  
<br>
See the <?php fileshow("ProofGeneral-3.2/INSTALL","INSTALL")?> 
file in the distribution for more details.
</p>

<h3><a name="xsyminstall">Easy installation of X-Symbol</a></h3> 

<p>
Contrary to what you may expect from the documentation of
X-Symbol, it's very easy to install and configures itself
automatically.
</p>
<p>
Simply download the binary package file, and do something
like this to install in your home directory:
</p>
<blockquote><tt>
 mkdir -p ~/.xemacs<br>
 cd ~/.xemacs<br>
 tar xpzf ../x-symbol-pkg.tar.gz<br>
</tt></blockquote>
