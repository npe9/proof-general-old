Proof General is available as an archive and an RPM package.

<p>
The archives and RPM include almost everything: the generic 
code, specific code for the supported provers, installation 
instructions and documentation in Info and HTML formats.
Documentation is available in other formats

<p> This version of Proof General has been tested with XEmacs 21.4 and
GNU Emacs 21.2.  It should work with <i>some</i> earlier versions of
XEmacs, but we recommend using of these Emacs versions for most
reliable results.  Support on GNU Emacs is catching up, but XEmacs is
still the better tested and more fully-featured environment.
See below for links.

<h2><a name="prereq">
    What you need to run Proof General
    </a>
</h2>
<p>
To run Proof General, you <strong>must</strong> have:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Version 21.1 or 21.4 
of <a href="http://www.xemacs.org">XEmacs</a>
(this UK 
<a href="http://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/Mirrors/ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/">
ftp mirror</a> may help).
<br>
<b>or</b> version 21.2 of 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>.
<br>
Both Emacsen are available for a variety of platforms, including
Unix variants, Windows 95/98/NT/2k, and Mac OS.
</li>
<li>
A proof assistant, for example:
<?php fileshow("ProofGeneral/coq/README","Coq"); ?>;
<?php fileshow("ProofGeneral/isa/README","Isabelle"); ?>
&nbsp;or <?php fileshow("ProofGeneral/isa/README","Isabelle/Isar"); ?>;
<?php fileshow("ProofGeneral/lego/README","LEGO"); ?>;
<?php fileshow("ProofGeneral/phox/README","PhoX"); ?>.
<br>
(click on links for version details; see <a href=".">front page</a> for
other assistants).
<br>
Or write your own support for a new assistant!
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There is also an <strong>optional</strong> component for using
Proof General:
<ul>
<li>
For displaying logical and mathematical symbols, the excellent
<a href="http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/">X-Symbol</a>
package. 
<br>It's very easy to install.  See <a href="#xsyminstall">here</a> 
for installation notes.
<br>Versions of X-Symbol supported:
<b>version 3.4 (stable)</b>, and <i>partially</i>, <b>version 4.4 (beta)</b>.
<br>
The stable version of X-Symbol only works with XEmacs on systems running X.
The beta version also works with Emacs 21.4 (not yet available), and 
has limited support for XEmacs on Windows.
</li>
<!-- <li> -->
<!-- For GNU Emacs, a version of <tt>func-menu.el</tt> to get  -->
<!-- <a href="features#funcmenu">function menus</a>. -->
<!-- <br>Unfortunately I can't find a version of this that -->
<!-- works with current GNU Emacs releases. I'd be grateful  -->
<!-- for a pointer to one.   -->
<!-- <br> -->
<!-- (The package  -->
<!-- <tt>imenu.el</tt> may be a suitable replacement, -->
<!-- and it ships with both Emacsen.  Perhaps   -->
<!-- somebody could contribute patches to use that  -->
<!-- instead of <tt>func-menu</tt>). -->
</ul>
Compatibility across the multitude of Emacs versions is quite troublesome. 
<br>
XEmacs has been better tested with Proof General than GNU Emacs.
<br>
Earlier versions of either variant <i>may</i> work with Proof General
but are not officially supported because we cannot test backward
compatibility widely. Please <a href="feedback">send us fixes</a>
rather than bug reports if you discover problems.
Later versions of both Emacs variants <i>should</i> work with
Proof General: if you discover problems, please check
to see if they have been solved in a more recent
<a href="develdownload">development release</a> before
reporting.


<h3><a name="install">Easy installation of Proof General</a></h3> 
<p>
To use Proof General, simply unpack the sources with 
</p>
 <blockquote>
   <tt>tar xpzf ProofGeneral-3.4.tar.gz</tt>
 </blockquote>
<p>
(use <tt>gunzip</tt> first in place of <tt>z</tt> if you don't have
GNU tar),<br> and then add this one line to your .emacs file:
</p>
 <blockquote>
  <tt> (load-file "<var>directory</var>/generic/proof-site.el")</tt>
 </blockquote>
<p>
Where <var>directory</var> is the directory in which you unpacked
the sources.  
<br>
If you use the RPM package, <var>directory</var> is
<tt>/usr/share/emacs/ProofGeneral</tt>
</p>
<p>
If you're using Windows, then download the zip file.
<br> 
Use a zip file utility to unpack it somewhere, for example
<tt>c:\ProofGeneral</tt>
</p>
<p>
Further customization is possible via the Customize menus in
Emacs.  
<br>
See the <?php fileshow("ProofGeneral-3.4/INSTALL","INSTALL")?> 
file in the distribution for more details.
</p>

<h3><a name="xsyminstall">Easy installation of X-Symbol</a></h3> 

<p>
X-Symbol is easy to install in XEmacs and configures itself automatically.
</p>
<p>
Simply download the binary package file, and do something
like this to install in your home directory:
</p>
<blockquote><tt>
 mkdir -p ~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages<br>
 cd ~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages<br>
 tar xpzf ../x-symbol-pkg.tar.gz<br>
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
For GNU Emacs, you must remove the <tt>.elc</tt> files supplied, and
add some code to your <tt>.emacs</tt>.  See 
<a href="http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/news.html">this page</a>
for details.
More installation options are given
in the <a href="http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/man/x-symbol_2.html">the X-Symbol manual</a>.
