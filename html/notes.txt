Developers' Notes about Web Pages
---------------------------------

NEW: server hacks needed to serve these pages, giving nice urls

 PHP3  module included
 .html treated as application

 Mime magic configured:

LoadModule mime_magic_module  modules/mod_mime_magic.so
AddModule mod_mime_magic.c
MimeMagicFile /etc/httpd/conf/magic

to recognize files beginning <?php, by
 adding this to /etc/httpd/conf/magic:

0	string		<?php		application/x-httpd-php3

Then add these links:

  news -> index.html
  doc -> index.html

etc.

***************

Notes about php:

Some functions I've written

 <?php hlink("html file","text","status message")?>

NB: no space after text so you must write
 
   <?php ... ?> blah 

to get a space.  Don't put "blah" onto a new line, space will
be lost!


*************

Tell Thomas (& other folk?) to update his home page links to Proof General.
[Probably okay: Thomas links to image in home directory, but we'll
 keep that as a copy of images/ProofGeneral.jpg]

*************

Suggestions for improving web pages after Rod reading them:

  - slideshow rather than single screen shot
  - separate feature list
  - explain what a proof script is and what script management buys you
