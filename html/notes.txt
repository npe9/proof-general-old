Developers' Notes about Web Pages
---------------------------------

Notes about php:

Some functions I've written

 <?php link_root("pagename","text")?>
 <?php hlink("html file","text","status message")?>

NB: no space after text in each case so you must write
 
   <?php ... ?> blah 

to get a space.  Don't put "blah" onto a new line, space will
be lost!

Tell Thomas (& other folk?) to update his home page links to Proof General.
[Probably okay: Thomas links to image in home directory, but we'll
 keep that as a copy of images/ProofGeneral.jpg]

*************

Suggestions for improving web pages after Rod reading them:

  - slideshow rather than single screen shot
  - separate feature list
  - explain what a proof script is and what script management buys you

Get Dave a laptop to do demos on!
