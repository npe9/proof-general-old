<li><b>24th June 1999</b><br>
  <p>
  New Proof General web pages go live!
  </p>
  <p>
  The general is now more serious looking.
  Appropriate, because there are some serious improvements 
  in the pipeline...
  Before that, we will release Proof General 2.1,
  mainly a bug-fix improvement of 2.0.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please explore the new web pages and report any problems 
  or suggestions to <?php pg_email() ?>.
  Please also try out the latest pre-release of Proof General,
  this is the final chance to get fixes and tweaks
  sorted before 2.1.
