Countdown to Proof General 3.1 begins.  This will be a bug fix releaase.
A few bugs have been fixed in
recent Proof General development releases, one important one is fixing
support for non-mule versions of FSF Emacs (thanks to Pierre Courtieu
for raising it to my attention).  I would like to release PG 3.1 next
month so that everyone can benefit.
<p>
In the meantime, please 
<?php hlink("feedback.phtml","report any important problems","Feedback form")?>
that you would like to see fixed, and consider trying out 
the current <a href="devel.phtml">development release</a>.

I'm pleased to say that Proof General will be demonstrated at
<a href="http://iks.cs.tu-berlin.de/etaps2000/etaps.html">ETAPS 2000</a>.
Here are some draft <a href="papers/pgtalk.pdf">slides</a> for 
the presentation 
(any <a href="mailto:da@dcs.ed.ac.uk">comments</a> would be welcome).
A presentation of Proof General based on these slides was given at 
<a href="http://www.clrc.ac.uk/">Rutherford Appleton Laboratory</a> last week.
