<p>
Improvements to web pages.  Graphics made smaller, text more concise.
Please <?php hlink("feedback.phtml","send me suggestions ","Feedback form")?>
for further improvements.
(I know some pages display poorly in Netscape 4.7x because 
of patchy stylesheet support; they appear much better in IE5
or the rather impressive recent versions of KDE's Konqueror).

<p>
We're starting the testing phase for Proof General 3.2.  
It has several new features and improvements.
Please try out the <a href="develdownload.phtml">pre-release</a>
version, and report any problems to us.  Your
feedback is very important because we have no resources available for
serious compatibility testing ourselves.
</p>
<p>
We hope to release 3.2 by the end of September.
