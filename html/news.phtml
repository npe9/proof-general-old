<li><b>13th September 1999</b><br>
 <p>
 I've just returned from the 
 <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/types-project/types-sum-school.html">Types Summer School, Giens, France</a>
 where Proof General was used for a class of
 about 50 students who were learning
 Coq, Isabelle, and LEGO.  I received
 many useful comments and feedback,
 which will be
 used to improve the next version.
 Thanks to everyone who gave suggestions and bug reports
 to me, including: 
 Michael Abbott,
 Bernd Grobauer,
 Sebastian Skalberg,
 Thierry Massart,
 Darmalingum Muthiayen.

 <p>
 Proof General version 2.1 is released.
 <br>
  Check the <?php fileshow("ProofGeneral-2.1/CHANGES","CHANGES"); ?> file
  for a summary of changes since Proof General 2.0.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is recommended that all users upgrade except
  those still using Isabelle 98-1.  
  <br> 
  Proof General 2.1 supports only the 99 version of Isabelle.

<li><b>24th June 1999</b><br>
  <p>
  New Proof General web pages go live!
  </p>
  <p>
  The general is now more serious looking.
  Appropriate, because there are some serious improvements 
  in the pipeline...
  Before that, we will release Proof General 2.1,
  mainly a bug-fix improvement of 2.0.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please explore the new web pages and report any problems 
  or suggestions to <?php pg_email() ?>.
  Please also try out the latest pre-release of Proof General,
  this is the final chance to get fixes and tweaks
  sorted before 2.1.
