A minor patch to Proof General 3.1 is released today.  To check what
version you have, look at the variable <tt>proof-general-version</tt>
set in <tt>proof-site.el</tt>.  (It is not recorded in the tar file
name or package version).  The current patch, to 3.1.4, was made to
fix a problem with Isabelle and theory file retraction, accidently
introduced in 3.1.  See <?php
fileshow("ProofGeneral-3.1-devel/etc/release-log.txt","the developer's
release log"); ?> for details.
NB: This patch was first made on 4th April, but didn't quite solve the
problem.  Thanks to Mike Squire for sending a patch to fix the fix.
</p>
<p>
Further improvements are being introduced in the new 3.2 pre-releases,
see the 
<a href="develdownload.phtml">development download</a> page, as usual.
