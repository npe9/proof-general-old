 <p>
 Recently there has been a flurry of work on the forthcoming Proof General 2.2. <br>  
 It has quite a number of improvements (see
 the <?php fileshow("ProofGeneral/CHANGES","CHANGES"); ?> file), made
 by myself and Markus Wenzel.  <br>
 Version 2.2 is aimed to coincide
 (or perhaps pre-empt) the release of Isabelle 99.
 </p>
 <p>
 At the moment we <b>urgently need</b> somebody from the Coq world to
 maintain and improve Coq Proof General, since Patrick Loiseleur 
 can no longer work on it.  <br>
 Support from the Coq community is vital for Proof General to
 be a useful tool there. <br>
 <a href="feedback.phtml">Please offer to help</a>, it needn't be 
 heavy commitment.

 I've just returned from the 
 <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/types-project/types-sum-school.html">Types Summer School, Giens, France</a>
 where Proof General was used for a class of
 about 50 students who were learning
 Coq, Isabelle, and LEGO.  I received
 many useful comments and feedback,
 which will be
 used to improve the next version.
 Thanks to everyone who gave suggestions and bug reports
 to me, including: 
 Michael Abbott,
 Bernd Grobauer,
 Sebastian Skalberg,
 Thierry Massart,
 Darmalingum Muthiayen.

 Print pictures from the new 
 <a href="gallery.phtml">gallery</a>
 of publicity shots of Proof General!

<li><b>24th August 1999</b><br>
 <p>
 Proof General version 2.1 is released.
 <br>
  Check the <?php fileshow("ProofGeneral-2.1/CHANGES","CHANGES"); ?> file
  for a summary of changes since Proof General 2.0.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is recommended that all users upgrade except
  those still using Isabelle 98-1.  
  <br> 
  Proof General 2.1 supports only the 99 version of Isabelle.

<li><b>24th June 1999</b><br>
  <p>
  New Proof General web pages go live!
  </p>
  <p>
  The general is now more serious looking.
  Appropriate, because there are some serious improvements 
  in the pipeline...
  Before that, we will release Proof General 2.1,
  mainly a bug-fix improvement of 2.0.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please explore the new web pages and report any problems 
  or suggestions to <?php pg_email() ?>.
  Please also try out the latest pre-release of Proof General,
  this is the final chance to get fixes and tweaks
  sorted before 2.1.
