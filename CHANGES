Plan of Major Changes for Proof General 2.2
-------------------------------------------


* Queue manipulation improvment: allow to extend or reduce
  during processing, with fewer "Proof Process Busy"
  messages.  

* Font-lock based on annotations in proof assistant output.
  Particularly: colouration for Isabelle variable names.

* x-symbol support integration.

* Isabelle PG: Non-blocking for .thy loading from .ML files.
  (hopefully as happy side effect of queue improvement)

Please send details of any other improvements or bug fixes you would
like to see, to proofgen@dcs.ed.ac.uk.
