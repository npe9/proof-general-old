* Summary of Changes for Proof General 4.0 from 3.7.X

** Generic changes

*** XEmacs is no longer supported; PG only works with GNU Emacs 22.2+

*** Font-lock based Unicode Tokens mode replaces X-Symbol

*** Removed configuration options
    proof-toolbar-use-button-enablers  (now always enabled)

*** Electric terminator configurable to not insert terminator
    This is the default behaviour for Isar with electric terminator
    (semicolon is more convenient than C-c C-RET or C-c C-n).
