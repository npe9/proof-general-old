* Summary of Changes for Proof General 3.1 from 3.0


** Generic Changes

*** Fixes for supporting Japan versions of Emacs which have older CL macs.
 
  CL macs with Japanicised documentation, defined in "egg.el".
  Japanese Emacs users, please report any other problems you find, they 
  may be fixable for similar reasons.

*** Minor bug fix for duplicated short output.
  
  Only seen with "val x=1" or similar messages.
  We now set proof-shell-eager-annotation-start-length appropriately.

*** Bug fix with .thy files and X-Symbol mode
  
  Subsequently visited theory files would have X-Symbols broken.  

*** Bug fix for (non-mule) FSF Emacs 20.5.  

  Emacs would freeze when starting proof assistant due to character 
  matching problem.

*** Fix for infamous Solaris ^G problem, now PG uses pipes

  We now set process-connection-type=nil to force piped communication
  instead of ptys.  However, ptys are to be prefered over pipes
  because pipes can become full or lose data.  Please report any
  problems of this nature you may suspect; if any are found we
  will only use pipes for Solaris.

** Coq Changes


** LEGO Changes

*** Fix for error messages, now properly displays "cannot assume" message.


** Isabelle Changes


** Isar Changes

*** Minor syntax tweaks.



** New instantiations of Proof General for:

*** Plastic (http://www.dur.ac.uk/CARG/plastic.html)
  
   by Paul Callaghan <P.C.Callaghan@durham.ac.uk>.
   The Plastic system itself is not yet publicly available.

*** HOL 98 (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/HVG/HOL/HOL.html)

   by David Aspinall.  This is a bare-bones Proof General instance
   only, hopefully to entice HOL users so that someone may improve it.
   See README in the hol98 directory for more details.


** Changes for developers to note
