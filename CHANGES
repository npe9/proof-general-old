Summary of Changes for Proof General 2.2 from 2.1
-------------------------------------------------

Generic Changes
---------------

* New function C-c C-f (proof-find) to invoke some prover-specific
  mechanism to search for theories.  Also a new toolbar button for it.

* Toolbar has five new buttons (State, Context, Info, Command,
  Help) which invoke commands previously available on keys/menus.

* Toolbar enablers have been added.   
  Buttons are automatically enabled or disabled as appropriate.   
  This requires XEmacs 20.4 or better for reliable working.  

* Terminal string now automatically added to command for C-c C-v 

* Cleaned up example files so all demonstrate same theorem "conj_comms".
  Would be nice to add more theorems to compare scripts/proofs in
  different systems.  Please send in example scripts!

* Shorter buffer names for convenience.
 
* Removed transparent gif (text logo) from splash screen 
  because XEmacs can't display it nicely.
 
* Documentation updates.


Coq Changes
-----------

* Set proof-{qed,save}-commands so the toolbar functions work.


Isabelle and Isar Changes
-------------------------

* Tweaks for input syntax.  

* Recognize goals of the old form val prems = goal ...


Only in the developers' release
-------------------------------

* Provisional instantiation of Proof General for
  Plastic (http://www.dur.ac.uk/CARG/plastic.html)
  by Paul Callaghan <P.C.Callaghan@durham.ac.uk>.


Internal changes for developers to note
---------------------------------------

* Code cleanups and improvements.
