Summary of Changes for Proof General 2.1 from 2.0
-------------------------------------------------

* Supports Coq 6.3.  

* Supports Isabelle 99.  Will not work with Isabelle 98.

* New instantiation of Proof General, for Isabelle/Isar 
  (new proof language for Isabelle 99) by 
  Markus Wenzel <wenzelm@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

* Documentation improvements.   
  Information added for Coq mode.

* In proof-site.el, the environment variable PROOFGENERAL_ASSISTANTS 
  is examined for the default value of proof-assistants.  No
  editing of proof-site.el should be needed now.

* Support for x-symbol package to beautify input and output with 
  special fonts.
  Patches for Isabelle provided by David von Oheimb.
  (work in progress)

* Improvements to Isabelle mode: multiple file handling now
  more robust and handled by Isabelle primitives.  
  Support added by Markus Wenzel.

* Improvements to Coq mode: better recognition of
  Coq syntax, support for proof-shell-restart-cmd.

* Toolbar can now be switched on and off via menu.
  Several other usability improvements added to menus.

* Bug fixes:
   - Long-lines with funny characters causing ^G's in Solaris.
   - Templates in Isabelle theory file mode.
   - Fix for case-insensitive matching.  Added proof-case-fold-search 
     configuration variable to allow for proof script languages with 
     case-insensitive syntax.
   - Process killing made robust.
   - Regular expression fixes causing "nil extent" errors.
