========================================


This is a "technology demonstration" of Proof General for ACL2.

It has basic script management support, with a little bit of
decoration of scripts and output.

There is support for X Symbol, but not using a proper token language.

I have written this in the hope that somebody from the ACL2 community
will adopt it, maintain and improve it, and thus turn it into a proper
instantiation of Proof General.
