Compatibility of Proof General
==============================

This version of Proof General has been tested with these Emacs versions
on recent Linux systems:

 Emacs 23.1            -- recommended and supported
 Emacs 22.3.1	       -- previous version, should work well

and (main) prover versions:  Coq 8.1pl3, Isabelle2009

See below for notes about other operating systems.

Maintaining compatibility across proof assistant versions, Emacs
versions and operating systems is virtually impossible.  In this major
release ** XEmacs compatibility has been dropped **

Running on Windows
------------------

For tips, please see here:

   http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki/PG/PGEmacsOnWindows

We recommend EmacsW32 available at:

   http://www.ourcomments.org/Emacs/EmacsW32.html

Unpack the Proof General tar or zip file, and rename the folder to
"ProofGeneral" to remove the version number.  Put a line like this:

   (load-file "c:\\ProofGeneral\\generic\\proof-site.el")

into .emacs.  You should put .emacs in value of HOME if you set that,
or else in directory you installled Emacs in, e.g.  
c:\Program Files\Emacs\.emacs

Note that Windows compatibility isn't thoroughly tested by the
maintainers.  If you discover problems, please send a report and/or
fix to the address above.



Running on Mac OS X
-------------------

We recommend the 23.1 build of GNU Emacs, which builds natively
on Mac OS X (based on the NextStep port).

Note that Mac compatibility isn't thoroughly tested.  If you discover
problems, please send a report and/or fix to the address above.
