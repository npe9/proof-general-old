Compatibility of Proof General
==============================

This version of Proof General has been tested with these Emacs versions
on Linux:

 Emacs 22.1.1		 -- recommended
 XEmacs 21.4.XX		 -- stable, but not recently tested
 XEmacs 21.5 (beta28)    -- tested, has patches for several XEmacs bugs

and prover versions:

 Coq 8.1
 Isabelle2005
 Isabelle2007

Maintaining compatibility across proof assistant versions, Emacs
versions and operating systems is a big challenge!  Please visit this
wiki page to check on others experience and report your own:

Backward compatibility and version-specific Emacs patches makes the
code into a bad mess.  Some compatibility has been removed here,
specifically affecting:

 Coq 7
 Isabelle 2004
 Earlier buggy versions of Emacs 21  (21.4.1 should work)
