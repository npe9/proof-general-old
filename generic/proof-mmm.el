;; it's own version before any other version on the Emacs load path.
;; If you want to override this, simply load your version before
;; starting Emacs, with (require 'mmm-auto).
;;
;; Configuration for the prover is expected to reside in <foo>-mmm.el
;; It should define an MMM submode class called <foo>.
