This is a pre-release of version 3.6 of Proof General.

We are working on improving Coq support of PG 3.5, including:

  -- fixes to X-Symbol symbols
  -- multiple file handling
  -- automatic adjusting of line width

There are other minor improvements to documentation, and some
improvements for Isabelle, in particular to support additional features
in the current CVS version of Isabelle.
