This is a pre-release of version 3.6 of Proof General.

There are improvements to Coq support, minor improvements to
documentation, and some improvements for Isabelle, in particular to
support additional features in Isabelle 2005.

Compatibility has been improved for more Emacs versions across
different operating systems.

Support for Unicode-safe interaction modes has been added (i.e.,
not using Unicode-prefix characters as specials).
