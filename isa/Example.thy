    The line at the top of this comment forces 
    Proof General's classic Isabelle mode;
    scripting takes place in .ML files.

    NB: this is incompatible with ProofGeneral/Isar which is
    a separate instance of Proof General.

    See the PG manual for ways to select Isabelle/Classic
    by default.
