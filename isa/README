========================================

Isabelle Proof General has full support for multiple file scripting,
with dependencies between theories communicated between Isabelle and
Proof General.  It has a mode for editing theory files taken from
Isamode.

There is proper support for X Symbol, using the Isabelle print mode
for X Symbol tokens.  Many Isabelle theories have X Symbol syntax
already defined and it's easy to add to your own theories.

There is no support for proof by pointing yet, and no tags program.

The script `interface' and file 'interface-setup.el' are used to start
Isabelle Proof General via the 'Isabelle' shell command.  These files
were provided by Markus Wenzel.
