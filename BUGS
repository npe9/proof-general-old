Known Bugs and Workarounds.
===========================

$Id$

* Outline-mode does not work in proof script files due to read-only
restrictions of protected region

* You can't use more than one proof assistant at a time in the same
Emacs session.  Nasty things happen if proof-assistants enables
more than one proof assistant and you load files for different
provers.  Workaround: stick to one prover per Emacs session!!

* There is an obscure bug with processes on Solaris which results in
buffers full of ^G after certain combinations of input.  Workaround:
get a patch from Sun, or use Linux.



Development  (move these above if decided not to fix):
======================================================

XEmacs sessions seem to grow excessively in terms of memory
allocation. Maybe some of the spans aren't removed properly.
Setting a limit on the size of the process buffer doesn't seem to
help.
