* Known Bugs and Workarounds for Proof General.

Generic bugs are listed here, which may affect all of the supported
provers.  See lego/BUGS coq/BUGS, etc, for specific bug lists for each
of the provers supported.

The bugs here are split into problems which apply for all Emacs
versions, and those which only apply to particular versions.


* Generic problems, for all Emacs versions

** If the proof assistant goes into a loop displaying lots of information

It may be difficult or impossible to interrupt it, because Emacs
doesn't get a chance to process the C-c C-c keypress or "Stop" button
push (or anything else).  In this situation, you will need to send an
interrupt to the (e.g.) Isabelle process from another shell.  This
problem can happen with looping rewrite rules in the Isabelle
simplifier, when tracing rewriting.

** Do not use C-x C-v or C-x C-w on a script file in active scripting mode

 Proof General will lose track of the file.
 Workaround: always turn off active scripting first with C-c C-s.

 Also there is a possibility (untested) of losing synchronization with
 multiple files if you use these functions.  To be safe, kill 
 the buffer first and use C-x C-f instead of C-x C-v, or kill
 and then re-find after C-x C-w.

** Toolbar enablers for XEmacs 21, some artefacts.

 There is a timing issue, so that occasionally the buttons are
 disabled/enabled when they shouldn't be.  An extra click on the
 toolbar solves this.

** Using C-g can leave script management in a mess.  

  The code is not fully protected from Emacs interrupts.
  Workaround: Don't type C-g while script management is processing.  
  If you do, use proof-restart-scripting.

** Outline-mode does not work in processed proof script files 

 Because of read-only restrictions of the protected region.  
 This is an inherent problem with outline because it works by 
 modifying the buffer.
 Workaround: none, nevermind.  (If it's hugely needed we could support
 modified outline commands).

** Multiple file scripting is slightly vulnerable.

 Files are not locked when they are being read by the prover, so a long
 file could be edited and saved as the prover is processing it,
 resulting in a loss of synchronization between Emacs and the proof
 assistant.  Files ought to be coloured red while they are being
 processed, just as single lines are.   Workaround: be careful not
 to edit a file as it is being read by the proof assistant!
 (Only applies to Lego and Isabelle)

** When proof-rsh-command is set to "ssh host", C-c C-c broken

 The whole process may be killed instead of interrupted.  This isn't a
 bug in Proof General, but the behaviour of ssh.  Try using rsh
 instead, it is said to forward signals to the remote command.

** In tty mode, the binding C-c C-RET has no effect.  

 Workaround: manually bind C-c RET to 'proof-goto-point instead.





* Problems with particular Emacs versions

** If you have problems using Mule versions of FSF Emacs 

Beware setting standard-display-european: Pascal Brisset suggests
adding this line to .emacs should help:

   (setq process-coding-system-alist '(("" . no-conversion))) 

** Strict read only disabled by default in FSF Emacs.

  Unfortunately strict read only is incompatible with font lock in
  FSF Emacs, so it is disabled by default.  Instead, you get a warning message
  if the locked region is edited.

** In FSFmacs, spurious "Region read only" errors

 Same problem as above, different symptom.
 When proof-strict-read-only is set and font lock is on, these
 errors are given which break font lock.   
 Workaround: turn off proof-strict-read-only, font-lock, or for
 the best of all possible worlds, switch to XEmacs.


** XEmacs undo in the script buffer can edit the "uneditable region"

  Test case: Insert some nonsense text after the locked region.
  Kill the line. Process to the next command.
  Press C-x u, nonsense text appears in locked region.
  Workaround: take care with undo in XEmacs.

** As of FSFmacs 20.3, multi-byte character codes are used.  

  This breaks some of the code in Proof General, which is turned off in
  case the suspicious looking function
  toggle-enable-multibyte-characters is present.  The code that is
  turned off deals with term markup for proof by pointing, which only
  affects LEGO at the moment.  This problem could affect forthcoming
  versions of XEmacs (but hasn't as far as XEmacs 21.1).  Can anybody
  tell me if it affects Mule versions of Emacs?  Workaround: for LEGO
  pbp, use FSFmacs 20.2, or XEmacs 20.4/later.

** XEmacs sometimes has strange start-up delays of several seconds.

 Possibly due to face allocation, when running remotely and
 displaying on an 8-bit display.  One workaround (and in fact the
 recommended way of working) is to run XEmacs locally and only
 the proof assistant on your fast compute server, by setting 
 proof-rsh-command.
