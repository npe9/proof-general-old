Known Bugs and Workarounds.
===========================

$Id$

* Toolbar: retract button can give "BUG" error message "called from
wrong buffer" when the process is inactive.

* Ordinary undo in script buffer can edit the "uneditable region"
in XEmacs.  This doesn't happen in FSFmacs.  Test case:
  Insert some nonsense text after the locked region.
  Kill the line. Process to the next command.
  Press C-x u, nonsense text appears in locked region.
Workaround: take care with undo in XEmacs.

* Using C-g can leave script management in a mess.  The code
needs to have some regions protected from Emacs interrupts.
Workaround: Don't type C-g while script management is processing.  If
you do, use proof-restart-scripting.

* You can't use more than one proof assistant at a time in the same
Emacs session.  Nasty things happen if proof-assistants enables
more than one proof assistant and you load files for different
provers.  Workaround: stick to one prover per Emacs session!

* Outline-mode does not work in proof script files due to read-only
restrictions of protected region.  Workaround: none, nevermind.
(If it's hugely needed we could support modified outline commands).

* There is an obscure bug with processes on Solaris which results in
buffers full of ^G after certain combinations of input.  Workaround:
get a patch from Sun, or use Linux.

* XEmacs sessions perhaps grow excessively in terms of memory
allocation. Maybe some of the spans aren't removed properly.
Setting a limit on the size of the process buffer doesn't seem to
help.  (1998/10/06: Is this bug still present?  Test examples?)
