The code in this directory is taken from  

	http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/

This is version 4.5  (based on pacakge release direct from author)

No changes have been made for Proof General, although the
following rearrangements from the package directory layout
have been made:

  for f in etc lisp man; do mv $f/x-symbol/* $f; rmdir $f/x-symbol; done

Moreover, lisp/Makefile and lisp/makefile.pkg were copied from
X-Symbol source package, and lisp/makefile.pkg edited to remove
x-symbol-emacs from list of compiled files (since it breaks 
on XEmacs compile).
