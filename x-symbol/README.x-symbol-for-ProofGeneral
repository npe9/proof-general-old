The code in this directory is taken from  

	http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/

This is version 4.5.1-beta (dated 2003-05-11 15:00)

No changes have been made for Proof General except the addition of the
string "[Proof General]" to x-symbol-version.  The following
rearrangements from the package directory layout have been made:

  for f in etc lisp man; do mv $f/x-symbol/* $f; rmdir $f/x-symbol; done

Moreover, lisp/Makefile and lisp/makefile.pkg were copied from
X-Symbol source package, and lisp/makefile.pkg edited to remove
x-symbol-emacs from list of compiled files (since it breaks 
on XEmacs compile).
