The code in this directory is taken from  

	http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net/

This is version 4.5.1-beta (dated 2003-05-11 15:00)

Some changes have been made for Proof General, including:

* the addition of 18pt and 24pt fonts, see etc/bigfonts.
  (thanks to Clemens Ballarin).  
* the addition of a mechanism to use Norbert Voelker's isaxsymb1.ttf 
  (see etc/fonts-ttf) automatically on Mac using Carbon Emacs.
  You need to install isaxsymb1.ttf into Font Book
  This is experimental support and may have some issues.
* addition of the string "[Proof General]" to x-symbol-version


The following rearrangements from the package directory layout have
been made:

  for f in etc lisp man; do mv $f/x-symbol/* $f; rmdir $f/x-symbol; done

Moreover, lisp/Makefile and lisp/makefile.pkg were copied from
X-Symbol source package, and lisp/makefile.pkg edited to remove
x-symbol-emacs from list of compiled files (since it breaks 
on XEmacs compile).
