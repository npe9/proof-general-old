* Things to do for Isabelle/Isar

See also ../todo for generic things to do, priority codes.

** C undo 'use' command: unlock corresponding ML file;

** C provide template for empty theory (or even just for Scratch.thy);

** C proper proof-by-pointing support (hard; needs major reworking of
Isabelle's pretty-printing subsystem);

** C speedup indentation (rather do this at generic level?); would be
nice if current indentation stack would be somehow stored within the
extend(s) processed last;

** C tune behaviour of goals/response buffers (e.g. hide empty
response buffers when using 2 buffer model);

** C eliminate x-symbol-isar.el in favour of shared x-symbol-isabelle.el;

** D Combine with isa/ to get single Isabelle PG instance, somehow?
Then users could use both proof languages in the same session.
