========================================

Isabelle/Isar Proof General has full support for multiple file
scripting, with dependencies between theories communicated between
Isabelle and Proof General.  

There is proper support for X Symbol, using the Isabelle print mode
for X Symbol tokens.  Many Isabelle theories have X Symbol syntax
already defined and it's easy to add to your own theories.

There is no support for proof by pointing yet, and no tags program.

The script `interface' and file 'interface-setup.el' are used
internally to start Isabelle Proof General via the 'Isabelle' shell
command.  This is the default way to invoke Proof General from the
Isabelle perspective.
