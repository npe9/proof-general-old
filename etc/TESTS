Some test cases for Proof General.
==================================

8.12.98  INHIBIT VARIABLES
==========================

  Test with proof-splash-inhibit=t

  Test with proof-toolbar-inhibit=t
  

8.12.98  SCRIPTING FOR BUFFERS WITHOUT FILES.
=============================================

  Switch to a fresh buffer FOO which doesn't visit a file.
  Do  M-x isa-mode RET.
  Should succeed.
  Try asserting commands, e.g. Goal "P-->P";

  Switch to another fresh buffer BAR, turn on isa-mode.
  Should succeed again.
  Try asserting commands here, e.g. Goal "Q&Q --> Q";
  Should give error "Cannot have more than one active scripting buffer".

  Exit emacs.  Should query whether we want to save these
  scripting buffers (maybe XEmacs only).
