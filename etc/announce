Subject: Proof General --- Version 2.0 release

           Announcing  Proof General  Version 2.0

   A Generic Emacs interface for Interactive Proof Assistants

            http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/proofgen

		 =========================

Proof General is supplied ready-customised for LEGO, Coq, and
Isabelle.  It includes these features (amongst others):

 . Script management: files and regions of files processed by
   prover have a blue background and are read-only; the state
   of the proof assistant is reflected inside the editor.
   Script management works across multiple files for
   LEGO and Isabelle.
   
 . Simplified communication: the proof assistant is run in
   an Emacs shell buffer, but by default it is hidden from view
   and only the most recent messages and proofstate are displayed
   to the user, simplifying the dialogue.
   
 . A toolbar for building and replaying proofs
 
 . Syntax highlighting of proof scripts and prover output
 
 . Menu for jumping to theorems in a proof script, Emacs outlining
   of proof scripts
   
 . Easy provision to run proof assistant on a remote host

See http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/proofgen/ProofGeneral/ProofGeneral.html
for the user manual which contains full details.

To users of LEGO, Coq, and Isabelle:
------------------------------------
This release of Proof General should be stable enough for you to use
happily.  Please try it and let us know what you think of it!

We have put a lot of work into the user documentation for Proof
General and making it robust and easy to install.  Ideally you should
use it with XEmacs, but it also works with limited features in FSF
Emacs.  We have tested on XEmacs 20.4 and Emacs 20.2, 20.3.  (It
probably works with earlier versions of either Emacs but we cannot
guarantee this).

To users of other proof assistants:
-----------------------------------
Our aim is provide a powerful and configurable Emacs mode which helps
user-interaction with interactive proof assistants.

Please help us with this aim!  The code of Proof General is designed
to be adaptable to other proof assistants, by writing a little bit of
Emacs Lisp (mainly regular expressions).  If you are using or
designing another proof assistant, please try configuring Proof
General for it, and let us know how you get on.

To Emacs gurus:
---------------
If you are an Emacs guru and want to contribute to the development of
Proof General, please join in!  There are plenty of exciting avenues
for improving this tool, for example, to add proof by pointing
facilities (a basis already exists for LEGO), and a theory browser.
