Please follow Emacs Lisp conventions as documented in the Emacs Lisp
manual.  The 'checkdoc' mode helps with this, enabled automatically,
alongside eldoc and Flyspell, in the development file:

 M-x load-file RET generic/pg-dev.el RET

 (load-file "../lib/pg-dev.el")

Compilation
===========

Please check that your code compiles to Lisp bytecode ("make foo/foo.elc")
and that the bytecode runs correctly.  Compilation not only speeds
up the running code, but conducts some useful static analysis.

To ensure correctness of running code, care is needed with macros (see
the Lisp reference manual) and load order.
