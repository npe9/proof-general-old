  Tested Emacs 20.2.1 with lego 1.3 via "ssh hope", 
		      with lego 1.3.1 via "ssh craro", LEGOVERSION "std"

  Both successfully process example.l
  Bug with killing off process shell via proof-shell-exit remains.

  With lego 1.3.1 via "ssh craro", LEGOVERSION "alpha", 
  processing gets stuck, never reports "imports done".  
  Is this a bug or problem with LEGO installation?
