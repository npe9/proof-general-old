  Tested Emacs 20.2.1 with lego 1.3 via "ssh hope", 
		      with lego 1.3.1 via "ssh craro", LEGOVERSION "std"

  Both successfully process example.l

  With lego 1.3.1 via "ssh craro", LEGOVERSION "alpha", 
  processing gets stuck, never reports "imports done".  
  Is this a bug or problem with LEGO installation?

  Bugs: 
    Killing off process shell via proof-shell-exit.
    Killing proof script buffer gives error.
