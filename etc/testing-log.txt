  Tested Emacs 20.2.1 with lego 1.3 via "ssh hope", 
		      with lego 1.3.1 via "ssh craro", LEGOVERSION "std"

  Both successfully process example.l

  With lego 1.3.1 via "ssh craro", LEGOVERSION "alpha", 
  processing gets stuck, never reports "imports done".  
  Is this a bug or problem with LEGO installation?

  Bugs: 
    Killing off process shell via proof-shell-exit.
    Killing proof script buffer gives error.

  On scar, tested Emacs 20.2.1 with lego 1.3.1 via "ssh craro",
  LEGOVERSION "std"

  emacs-20.2 -eval '(progn (load
  "/home/tms/emacs/ProofGeneral/generic/proof-site.el")(setq
  proof-rsh-command "ssh craro"))' lego/example.l 

  Pressing C-c C-n crashes Emacs: Fatal error (11).Segmentation fault

  This must be a problem with my .emacs file. Including -q in the
  options, everyting seems to work just fine. Still, this is somewhat
  concerning.

  Clarification of entry "Mon Dec 14 15:02:52 GMT 1998  da"

  The problem with LEGOVERSION "alpha" can also be reproduced with
  lego 1.3.1 (and XEmacs 20.4 or FSF Emacs 20.2) and the file
  lego/example2.l which accesses a module in a non-writable directory.
  You need to set chmod u-w readonly yourself; CVS doesn't like
  non-writable directories)
  It is a LEGO specific problem. LEGO forgets about annotations
  sometimes. This has been reported to lego@dcs.ed.ac.uk .
