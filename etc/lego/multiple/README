Handling of Multiple Files
==========================


Test Protocol
-------------

 1) visit A.l
 2) visit C.l
 3) assert C       =>   all of C should be locked
 4) switch to A.l  =>   all of A should be locked
 5) visit B.l      =>   all of B should be locked
 6) visit D.l      =>   D should not be locked
 7) retract to middle of B  =>   B should be (completely) unlocked
 8) assert first command of B
 9) A should still be locked; C and D should be unlocked
10) assert C       => should signal error
11) assert B then D => A,B,D should be locked and C unlocked
12) retract B => A should be locked; B,C should be unlocked 
                    D should be unlocked in systems with linear
                    dependencies (e.g. LEGO)
13) assert C  => A,B,C should be locked; status of D unchanged
14) M-x proof-restart-script => A,B,C,D should be unlocked
