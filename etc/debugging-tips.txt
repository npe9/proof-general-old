Tips for Debugging Proof General   -- David Aspinall, 1999,2002
===============================================================

Emacs debug flags
=================

If Proof General gives an error, you can set the Emacs debug
flag to find out where in the code it occurs, showing a
stack trace:

 (setq debug-on-error t)    ; debug on errors
 (setq debugon-on-quit t)   ; debug on CTRL-G for looping code

You can make settings like this using M-x set-variable, writing Lisp
code as above in the *scratch* buffer, and typing C-x C-e to evaluate
the expressions, or using M-x eval-expression (ESC-:).


Quick hints for edebug (source-level debugger)
==============================================

Source-level debugging is more useful than backtraces, especially if
you are writing your own additions for Proof General.

Load the source file <foo>.el, and locate the function you 
want to debug.  Type

   M-x debug-defun RET

to instrument it for debugging.

When the code reaches the function it will enter the source-level
debugger.  Keep pressing space to step through and see the result of
evaluating sub-expressions, or hit "c" to continue.  

Pressing ? gives more commands.



Proof General debug messages
============================

Proof General includes internal debugging messages.
Make these settings to see them:

  (setq proof-tidy-response nil)	; response buffer never clears
  (setq proof-show-debug-messages t)    ; debug messages appear in response buffer
