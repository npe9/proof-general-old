Tips for Debugging Proof General   -- David Aspinall, Oct 1999.

Make these settings:

  (setq proof-tidy-response nil)	; response buffer never clears
  (setq proof-show-debug-messages t)    ; debug messages appear in response buffer

And use the standard elisp package "edebug" to single-step at source
level, and set breakpoints in code.
