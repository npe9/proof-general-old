Test cases for PG and/or Emacs bugs.

----------------

* Coq, and others bug: synchronization not gained until second line.

Test in Coq buffer:

  Print foo.

Should give error, but PG ignores it and colours command blue.
Similar errors for some other provers.

[ Now fixed in 3.2pre ]




----------------

* XEmacs bug: buffer-syntactic-context-depth returns weird values

Seems to depend on previous history.  Test in Coq buffer:
  
   X
  (* comment one *)
   Y
  (* comment two *)
   Z

Evaluate (buffer-syntactic-context-depth) at X, Y, then Z.
Values 0, 1, 2.  Evaluate at point Y.  Now get 0.
Perhaps caches previous value, and bases parse on moving point
forwards from previous value?  Anyway, doesn't do well with
block comments.  Also bad with line comments, use same test
case with buffer in lisp mode, except with lisp comments.

Shame, would be nice to use this to help parse lisp-like
syntax for PAs, fitting in with present scheme.
