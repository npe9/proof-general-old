About Proof General Kit
=======================

Proof General has been Emacs based so far, but plans are afoot to
liberate it from the points and parentheses of Emacs Lisp.  The
successor framework, Proof General Kit, proposes that proof assistants
use a *standard* XML-based protocol for interactive proof, dubbed
PGIP.  

PGIP will allow a middleware layer for many interactive proof tools
and interface components (including Emacs).  The design of PGIP was
made possible by the present Emacs-based Proof General framework.  

The code included here is not yet in a working state.  Check the latest
development release of Proof General, and visit:
