Presently Coq Proof General supports automatic multiple file support
only (deduced file dependencies, not communicated ones).  It does not
have support for proof by pointing.

There is support for x-symbols, but not using a proper token
language.  Try writing "philosophy" !

There is a tags program, coqtags.
