* Things to do for Coq
======================

B C-c C-c breaks the coherence with prover state
  (da: can somebody tell me if this is still true? 
   what problem specifically?)

B Proof-by-Pointing [1 month]
  da: Yves Bertot told me that his CtCoq proof-by-pointing code
  is in the Coq kernel now, so would be useful for PG.
  We need a Coq hacker to do this (Pierre?)

C Improve X-Symbol support.  Integrate with Coq syntax mechanism somehow?

C Retraction in a Section should retract to the beginning of the whole 
  section. See the section "Granularity of
  Atomic Commands" for a proposal on how to generalise the current
  implementation so that it can also deal with sections.
  [See also the LEGO problem with Discharge] (6h)

D Add Patrick Loiseleur's commands to search for vernac or ml files.
  (they are in a separate file that is part of Coq distrib.
   should I really integrate that in PG ? Patrick) 
  (maybe not if they're orthogonal to PG, but might help users - da)

D Add coq-add-tactic with a tactic name, which adds that tactic to the 
  undoable tactics and to the font-lock. (2h)

D Improve coqtags. It cannot handle lists e.g., with 	
	Parameter x,y:nat
  it only tags x but not y. [The same problem exists for legotags]
