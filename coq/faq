This is a small FAQ for users of coq proof general.

* Three windows mode

It has been cleaned up. Here is how it works now.

** How do I enable three windows mode?

Menu Coq > toggle 3 windows mode

** How do I enable three windows mode by default?

Put this in you configuration file:

(setq proof-three-window-enable t)

** What are the possible layouts in 3 windows mode

The are three layouts:
  - vertical: the 3 buffers are displayed in one column.
  - hybrid: 2 columns mode, left column displays scripting buffer
    and right column displays the 2 others.
  - horizontal: 3 columns mode, one for each buffer (script, goals,
    response).

** What is the default layout?

The default layout is a "smart" one. One of the three layouts is
chosen depending on the current width of your emacs frame. The
threshold between is given by variable split-width-threshold:

 width < split-width-threshold ===> vertical mode
 split-width-threshold <= width < 1.5 * split-width-threshold ===> hybrid mode
 width <= split-width-threshold ===> horizontal mode

** How do I change the theshold between display modes in default mode?

You can change the value of `split-width-threshold' at your will by
putting this in your emacs configuration file:

(setq split-width-threshold 140)

Note that this is a global emacs setting, that may affect the way
frames are split by other modes. See description of function
`split-window-sensibly' for details.

** I changed the size of my frame and layout did not changed, what happened?

Hit C-c C-l to refresh layout, it will adapt to the new frame width.

** I don't like the default layout of three windows mode, how can I force it?

If you want to force one layout instead of letting emacs chose it for
you (see above question "what is the default layout?"), you can set
the variable `proof-three-window-mode-policy'. The three possible
values are: 'smart (default), 'vertical, 'horizontal, 'hybrid.

For example, putting this in your configuration file will force hybrid
mode:

(setq proof-three-window-mode-policy 'hybrid)


* other interface questions

** How do I disable the splash screen?

Put this in your configuration file:

(setq proof-splash-enable nil)

** How do I enable the "compile before require" mode by default? 

Put this in your configuration file:

(setq coq-compile-before-require t)

** Until now hovering the mouse cursor on the locked region
   was popping up some windows showing coq output, how do I bring
   this back?

This was removed because it was considered by many as more annoying
than useful, you can bring it back by:

Menu Coq / toggle tooltips.

** Electric terminator always goes to next line, how do I change this?

You can disable this by putting this in your configuration file:

(setq coq-one-command-per-line nil)


** How do I change the color of the queue/locked region?

(custom-set-faces
 '(proof-queue-face
   ((((type x) (class color) (background light))
     (:background "darksalmon"))) t)
 '(proof-locked-face
   ((((type x) (class color) (background light)) (:background "SlateGray3"))) t))
