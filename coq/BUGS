* Coq Proof General Bugs

See also ../BUGS for generic bugs.

** With new syntax in Coq 7, comments at end of files cannot be processed.

Leads to annoying retract/process questions when switching buffers.
Workaround: don't use a comment as the last line of the buffer, for now.

** coqtags doesn't find all declarations. 

It cannot handle lists e.g., with "Parameter x,y:nat" it only tags x
but not y. [The same problem exists for legotags] Workaround: don't
rely too much on the etags mechanism.

** With Coq 7, multiple file handling and auto-compilation is buggy

** Surely others that aren't mentioned here...
