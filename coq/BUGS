* Coq Proof General Bugs

See also ../BUGS for generic bugs.

** coqtags doesn't find all declarations. 

It cannot handle lists e.g., with "Parameter x,y:nat" it only tags x
but not y. [The same problem exists for legotags] Workaround: don't
rely too much on the etags mechanism.

** User defined tactics cannot be retracted. 

 Workaround: you may need to retract to the beginning of the proof.

** Surely others that aren't mentioned here...
