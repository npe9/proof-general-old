* Summary of Changes for coq / Proof General 3.7

*** Much better PG/Coq synchronizing system

    Synchronization is not based on script parsing anymore, which
    makes it much more reliable. 

    In particular you don't need to set
    coq-user-state-changing-commands and others anymore (was needed
    for your own tactics/commands). See next point.

*** new variables coq-user-commands-db and coq-user-tactics-db

    User defined tactics/commands information.  See C-h v coq-syntax-db
    for syntax. It is not necessary to add your own tactics here (it is
    not needed by the synchronizing/backtracking system). You may
    however do so for the following reasons:

    1 your tactics/commands will be colorized by font-lock

    2 your tactics/commands will be added to the menu and to completion
    when calling \\[coq-insert-tactic/command] (see below)

    3 you may define an abbreviation for your tactic/command.

*** Much better indentation

*** better font-lock coloration

*** new coq-insert-tactic and coq-insert-command function

    These two functions allow to insert a tactic or command with
    completion in the mini-buffer.

*** Local Variables List semi automatic filling

    Local Variables Lists are used to set coq program name and arguments
    persistently for a given file. The menu entry "set coq prog
    persistently" helps you to define or change the values in this list
    (which are store as a comment at the end of the file, see info
    manual at node ((emacs)File Variables).

*** automatic insertion of "match...with" for a given type

    This coqide great feature has been added

*** new "queries" menu
